        <p> 
            To build this website, I considered a number of different factors. I chose an issue that I believe
            has a large breadth of impact (global energy generation) and focused on a particular subsection that I feel
            has been unjustly written off.
        </p> 
        <p>
            In my opinion, nuclear energy would be a great tool in the fight against climate change, 
            but has been declining in popularity because it has an image issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            So on this site, I chose to help educate people about nuclear energy, and address misconceptions.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In my research, I found that most people posess one of three key misconceptions about nuclear power. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <span> 1. That nuclear powerplants can be easily weaponized </span>
            <span> 2. that nuclear power aids weapon proliforation </span>
            <span> 3. That nucler energy presents a danger to the public </span>
        </ul>
        <p>
            On this site I refute all three of these misconceptions in one way or another, and I tried my best to give consistent
            and belivable arguments for them.
