      <h1> The Argument for Nuclear Energy </h1>
      <h2> Vs Fossil Fuels </h2>
      <p> 
          Over the past 70 years, nuclear energy has had an eventful run. Developed after World War II, it got caught up in 
          the technological race between the United States and the USSR. Everyone had big dreams for nuclear energy, 
          "the jetsons" idealized the public's hope for the future. Though after two huge disasters nuclear energy fell out of public favor. 
      </p>
        <p>
            Over the past couple of decades, however, as the world faces the immenent threat of global climate change,
            some have looked back at nuclear for help in our current state.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Despite it's depiction in news, iconography, and media, nuclear energy is one of the safest forms of energy generation
            availible. Unlike coal, oil, and natural gas, whose emissions cause hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks every year, nuclear energy has no 
            atmospheric emissions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a graph detailing the number of human deaths every form of energy generation has been responsible for, in Terawatt hours, 
            over all time, not including deaths from climate change, the most significant issue with the consumption of fossil fuel.

            Like fossil fuels, nuclear fuel is mined from the ground, but unlike fossil fuels, it is not a very rare resource. With the latest
            technology, the amount of fuel that is left on earth could power humanity <a href="https://whatisnuclear.com/blog/2020-10-28-nuclear-energy-is-longterm-sustainable.html">until the sun burned out.</a>.
        </p>

        <h2> Vs. Wind and Solar </h2>
        <p>
            The reason that the world will never be able to fully rely on the renewables wind and solar alone, is because 
            we don't possess the energy storage technology to make their variable energy outputs consistent. Nuclear energy,
            is never reliant on the wind blowing or the sun shining to produce electricity. It can run around the clock changing itself
            to meet energy demand. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Scientists frequently use the following graph to describe average energy needs over the day;

        <p>
            Energy is needed most when people are waking up and getting ready for the day, and when they are winding down
            and cooking dinner in the evening. One very useful aspect of using fossil fuels to generate electricity, is that
            output is highly variable. If you need more electricity, just burn more coal. The greatest weakness of solar and wind
            are that they cannot meet this demand. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Nuclear energy, on the other hand, is very capable of meeting the variable demand of energy thought the day. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Famous nuclear physicist Richard Feynmann once said, "To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the gates of hell."
            Feynmann worked on the manhattan project, and was aware of both the great good and evil that nuclear energy could produce,  
            and in the era of climate change, it may be time to reevaluate our assumptions about nuclear energy, because it might just
            save us from catastrophe.
